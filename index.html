    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Learn to code (even if it's just on a basic level) before coding becomes obsolete and AI takes over as God intended</li>
        <li>Make some money from peddling low effort websites</li>
        <li>Enjoy life a bit for a change</li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>Boy was that a waste of time<br />
        Got a Bachelor's Degree in Language, Literature, Culture though<br />
        <a href="https://www.fil.bg.ac.rs/en">This is where I wasted four and a half years of my life</a><br/>

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <h3>Travel Consultant at <a href="https://www.dnata.com/en">dnata</a></h3>

    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Basic Computer Skills: &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;</li>
        <li>Customer Service: &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;<br />
            I have a knack for customer service, but I absolutely despise that line of work.<br />
        </li>
        <li>Organizational Skills: &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;<br />
            As long as the workload is within the limits of reason, I can manage it well.<br />
            Sadly, a reasonable workload is a rarity in this day and age.<br />
        </li>
        <li>Attention to details: &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;<br />
            I prefer a slower work tempo where I can double-check everything and make sure that no errors slipped through.<br />
        </li>
    </ul>
